# ðŸŒ¿ GrowLux

A responsive web application that uses your device camera to measure ambient light intensity for plants.

## Features

- ðŸ“± Mobile-responsive design
- ðŸ“· Camera-based light measurement
- ðŸŒ± Plant Mode: Light levels optimized for plant care
- ðŸ“Š Raw Mode: Numeric lux values and percentages
- ðŸŽ¨ Nature-inspired green color palette
- ðŸ”„ Real-time light monitoring

## How it works

GrowLux captures video frames from your device camera and analyzes pixel brightness using the standard luminance formula (Y = 0.299*R + 0.587*G + 0.114*B) to estimate ambient light levels.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. Click "Start Measurement" to grant camera access
3. Point your camera at the area you want to measure
4. Toggle between Plant Mode and Raw Mode as needed
